  "body": "I was leaving work and saw a woman walking a dog that looked exactly like my wife’s from the back. Same leash, same coat, even had the little pink bandana.\n\nI was in my car pulling out of the lot and thought it would be cute to surprise her, so I rolled down the window and yelled:\n\n“Hey sexy! I love you, baby!”\n\nThe woman turned around… and it wasn’t my wife. It was her boss.\nThe dog? Similar. Not the same.\n\nThe woman? Mortified. She recognized me.\n\nShe works in the same building. My wife now has to explain why her husband shouted “I love you, baby” to her supervisor in the parking lot like we’re in a low-budget romcom.\n\nTL;DR: Thought I saw my wife walking our dog. Shouted “I love you” from the car. It was her boss. Now I’m banned from pickup duty.",
