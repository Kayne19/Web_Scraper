  "body": "I posted yesterday about my oversight in reading the lease, which said vacating notice must be “written and mailed.” I sent out vacating notice by email assuming it would be okay, but then got charged $2000 for the next month’s rent. Freaking out, I assumed I messed up royally and would have to just pay. I thought they must have actually wanted a paper in an envelope snail mailed from my apartment door to their office about 100 feet away.\n\nLots of people said to fight back yesterday. I was feeling hopeless about it. If the lease says X and I do Y, of course I’m guilty and should be held liable. But I’m a broke graduate and couldn’t easily afford $2k, so I called this AM.\n\nLeasing office confirmed that an email notice is OKAY. But, the property manager who I emailed didn’t enter it into the system. She called me profusely apologizing. I had her email me a confirmation afterward for the paper trail. The charge was canceled and I am officially on the books to move out.\n\nAll set! Thanks everyone for the support. Learned a bit about property law and also the biggest lessons: 1) read the lease carefully, and 2) follow up if you don’t get a response.\n\nTL;DR I didn’t FU, and I was able to resolve the problem.
