  "body": "Hello Reddit, this is awkward to post, but I don’t know who to tell and I want to share this to someone else.\n\nWent in for my annual physical. I’m already awkward at the doctor’s office, so I nervously babble or do the whole nod-and-smile thing.\n\nAnyway, the doctor walks in, chats a bit, and says, “Okay, take your pants off and lie on the table.”\n\nAnd my dumb ass, instinctively, says: “You too.”\n\nThere was a long pause. He blinked. I blinked. We both knew what I said, and yet neither of us addressed it.\n\nHe just moved on like a champ. Professionalism of the highest order.\n\nI lay on the table in complete silence, fully understanding that I’ll never emotionally recover from this.\n\nTL;DR: Doctor told me to take my pants off. I said “you too.” I want to die.",
