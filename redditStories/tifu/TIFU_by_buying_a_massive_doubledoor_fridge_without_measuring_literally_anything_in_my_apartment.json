  "title": "TIFU by buying a massive double-door fridge without measuring literally anything in my apartment",
  "body": "This disaster unfolded over the weekend and I'm still living in denial about the $1,200 appliance currently blocking my building's hallway 💀  \nSo my old fridge finally died (RIP to 8 years of faithful service), and I had some cash saved up from a work bonus recently. Saw this gorgeous stainless steel double-door beauty on sale and just... bought it. Like a complete amateur who apparently forgot that physics exists.  \nThe delivery guys showed up Saturday morning, took one look at my second-floor walkup situation, and basically went \"lol good luck.\" No elevator obviously, just narrow stairs and a hallway that was clearly designed by someone who hates large appliances.  \nMy boyfriend and three of his friends volunteered to help (bless them), thinking \"how hard could it be?\" Cut to 2 HOURS of them trying every possible angle, removing the doors, tilting it sideways, basically attempting fridge Tetris while I stood there having a full existential crisis.  \n  \nPlot twist: even if we somehow defied the laws of space and time to get it upstairs, there's this sharp 90-degree turn right at my apartment door that makes zero geometric sense for anything wider than a pizza box.  \nSo now I have a $1,200 fridge chilling in the hallway (literally, it's still plugged in because I'm in denial), my neighbors think I'm insane, and I'm googling \"do appliance stores take returns on items that are technically homeless?\"  \n  \nTL;DR: Bought a fridge that's physically impossible to get into my apartment, now I'm the building's unofficial hallway appliance dealer and my ego is in shambles.",
