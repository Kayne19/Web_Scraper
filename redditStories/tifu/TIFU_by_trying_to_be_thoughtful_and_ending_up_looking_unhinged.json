  "body": "So my girlfriend’s been stressed lately work stuff, life stuff, all of it. I thought, “you know what? I’ll do something nice for her.” Clean the flat, cook a proper meal, set up a little vibe. Not anything mad, just something decent.\n\nI start tidying. All good. Then I think, candles would be a nice touch. I find one she likes, light it. Then I think music. I make a playlist. Then I think bath. She loves baths.\n\nHere’s where I went wrong. I filled the bath way too early. Way. Too. Early. Like 45 mins before she’d even be home. Water goes lukewarm. So I try to top it up with hot water… forget I’m doing it. Go back to the kitchen to plate up food. Burn the garlic bread. Smoke alarm starts going off. Run to stop that, slip a bit.\n\nThen I hear the bath overflowing. Floor’s soaked. I throw towels down like that’s gonna help. In the middle of this she walks in the door. I’m drenched. Garlic bread is black. Bath’s spilling out. Her exact words were:\n\n“Were you trying to kill me or propose?”\n\nIt was supposed to be thoughtful. It looked like a crime scene.\n\nShe laughed eventually. But yeah, I think I’m just gonna stick to takeaway next time.\n\nTL;DR:\nTried to surprise my girlfriend with a relaxing night — ended up flooding the bathroom, burning the food, and nearly setting off the fire alarm. Thoughtful turned terrifying.",
