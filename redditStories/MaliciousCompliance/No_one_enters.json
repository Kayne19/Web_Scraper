  "body": "25 years ago I worked as a bouncer in RI at Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel. Lupos was an amazing live music venue. I was working the side door to the establishment; the door was only used to let in members of the bands playing that night or employees. The band playing that night was George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic. The opening band had already come in and all the employees working as well. George and the band were still in their tour bus. This is when the head bouncer walks over to me and says that \"no one else is to come through the side door.\" To this day I have no idea why; he had never said this before. With a confused look on my face I asked \"Nobody?\" \"Nobody\" he repeated. Still perplexed I asked again \"Nobody? No matter who they are or who they are with?\" \"Nobody!\" he practically screamed at me. \"Okay\" I conceded. Not 5 minutes later one of the bands roadies came to the door and told me they were ready to come in. I told him that they would have to go to the main entrance.  He looked confused as he had already been back and forth through the door multiple times while setting up. I told him my boss just told me that nobody, no matter who they were, could come in this way. Visibly pissed he turned and went around to the main entrance. 1 minute later my boss came storming over to me, looking both pissed and sheepish at the same time, tells me to let in anyone with the band. I just smiled at him and nodded my head. 1 minute later the band and the bands hang arounds and groupies and random fans that were on the bus all come strolling in. All told, about thirty people. I could see my boss seething up by the main entrance as they all came in. ",
