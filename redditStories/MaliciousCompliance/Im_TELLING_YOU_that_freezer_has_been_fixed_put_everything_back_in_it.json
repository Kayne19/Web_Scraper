  "body": "So this happened when I was about 16 and working at a TCBY. I was about to get off work when the store manager told me to take all of the display ice cream cakes and put them into the back freezer because the front freezer wasn't working. She then left for the day. About an hour after I did this, the store owner walks in yelling \"why are all the display cakes not in the front freezer???? We just had it fixed!\"\n\nI told him that I literally just got done taking them out and putting them in the back per the manager's request. Some back and forth went on until I just shrugged and put all the cakes back into the broken front freezer and left. All the cakes melted and I was fired. Oh well lol",
