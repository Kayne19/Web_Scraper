She was so proud of herself it was hilarious.\n\nEdit: to add some context...\nShe was 3 almost 4 when this happened. It happened 4 years ago, it popped up in my Facebook feed. We also didn't have an issue with our kids putting stickers up, but she had emptied a sticker book like 3 days in a row, so it was getting old.\n\nMy wife and I both thought it was hilarious. My wife got a picture of her next to her work with the biggest shit eating grin you can imagine. \n\nI showed her the pic today, she's almost 8 and she cracked up saying that sounds like someone she would have done.",
