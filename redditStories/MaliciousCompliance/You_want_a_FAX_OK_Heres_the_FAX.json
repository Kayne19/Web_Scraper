  "body": "I had a consulting contract with a large financial services company. One of the rules was that I was not allowed to have investment accounts with any other companies. (They were afraid of insider trading). The exception was accounts that were managed so I was not making the investment decisions. In order to get this waiver, I needed a statement from the company that held the accounts. I called my financial adviser and he said it was common practice in the industry and would send me the standard one page letter that listed the details of my three accounts. \n\nI eMailed the letter to HQ and they rejected it. They needed a copy of the complete customer agreement for each account. I explained the the agreement was 60 pages long and I had 3 accounts. Sorry, No exceptions \n\nI said I had PDF copies of the documents. They were too big to eMail. Could I just upload them to some server so they could fetch them? \n\nNo, All documents must be hand delivered or FAXed \n\nThis client was paying about $125/hour for my services. I spent an entire day printing the docs (on their printer) and created a separate FAX job (with cover page) for each page.\n\nFor the next 10 years I had 5 or 6 contracts with this company and each time I had to apply for the same waiver and FAX the same documents to the same office.",
