She wanted to upsell services, etc and get personal information she did not need to complicate what was supposed to be an easy request. It went on for a while like this. \n\nI finally stepped in and shut that down, confirmed a cancellation, and handed the phone back to him and walked away. The agent insisted it was nothing personal, just company policy to engage in “customer retention” efforts. He moved across country. He told her that- there is no retention possible. Still, she kept him going in circles unnecessarily. \n\nI can hear the agent now begging him to hang up from the other room. \n\nThis call agent cannot end the call. Company policy is that the customer ends the call. \n\nMy Father in Law can not hear her as he and my mother in law are happily chatting away about elderly bodily functions and peanut butter crackers with apples while this poor agent is literally begging them to end the call. \n\nI will not end her nightmare.
