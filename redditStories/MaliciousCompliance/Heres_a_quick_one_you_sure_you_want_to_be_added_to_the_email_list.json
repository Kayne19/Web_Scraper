These new white shirts (admin employees) wanted to be a part of the action and requested to be added to the email list for incidents that we report. We're like \"that's a lot of emails, are you sure?\" (Roughly 45 emails per day) \"Yes! We need to stay informed!\". \n\nI come into work today (two days after their request) and see that they are no longer on the list to be included for all incidents. They said it's too many emails and wanted off the list. \n\nThat's it, not super juicy but I thought it was fun enough to include. Thanks for reading! \n\nEdit- \"a part\" apparently.",
