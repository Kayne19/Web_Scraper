  "body": "I used to smoke behind a dumpster at the back of the apartment complex, well over 40 feet from a building.  But they decided to post a new rule that the entire property is smoke free, and if you get caught it's a 200 dollar fine.  So now I smoke 1 foot outside the entrance of the apartment complex, I'm sure the new residents love to see that.",
