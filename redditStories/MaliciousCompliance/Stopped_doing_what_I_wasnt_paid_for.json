  "body": "I worked in a big compagny. I did the developer (tech lead) job, project manager's job and a big part of team leader's job. \n\nI asked multiple times to have a raise and also less work. That didn't work. When I said I did all of that, my manager just answered \"Yes, you do a spectacular work. But we don't ask you to do all of this. So I don't know why you should get paid more than other people.\"\n\nWell... I stopped doing extras and focused on my job for 3 months. \n\nEverything collapsed bit by bit expect the projects I kept working on. When I was asked by the clients, I just answered:\" oh, I'm not in charge of that. You should contact X or the manager, not me. \"\n\nI was asked to come into the manager's office : \"why is everything falling apart?! You need to do something!\" \n\nMe : \"it's not my job. For years, you didn't asked yourself how it happened that everything worked so fine. So I stopped doing what was not in my contract. Now you ask why it's not working anymore. The answer is just that I let things fall down. And I'm glad it did because only now you notice the work I did.\".\n\nHe was really confused. Got a raise pretty fast. \n\nEdit : language mistakes ",
