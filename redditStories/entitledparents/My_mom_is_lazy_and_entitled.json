  "body": "So my mom basically does nothing all day and yet whenever I come back from uni the first thing she says is that she’s been very busy the entire day while she actually didn’t do anything besides spending 3-4 hours on TikTok. I do lots of activities in a day like going to uni, study for my tests or go to Pilates classes but my mom does literally nothing besides complaining about having migraine whenever I’m trying to have a conversation with her about something. She has been living in the Netherlands for more than 20 years but her Dutch is not very good and every time I tell her to go learn Dutch she always comes up with a weird excuse about being “busy”. She walks around 2 km in a day and says that she’s very tired and has no energy. Grocery shopping ends up in a long complaining rant. She is a lazy cook as well and hates it when I try to cook something because I’m tired of eating the same food every day. I feel like something is wrong with her and I just can’t fix her. ",
